This a port/remake of a previous homebrew I did for the [SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis](https://drludos.itch.io/meteorain-gameshell-jam-1), buy I programmed this version from scratch as this version was **100% made in Lua!** Indeed, I used the wonderful **BPCore-Engine by Evan Bowman**, that allows you to create a GBA game in Lua. If you ever used a fantasy console like PICO-8 or TIC-80, it's a very similar tool, but the resulting game will run on a actual console, our beloved GameBoy Advance! If you want to try your hand at making GBA games, I really recommend you BPCore-Engine, it's a real pleasure to make games with it:

And I'm sharing the heavily commented code source of my own game here if it can help you making your own GBA games in Lua!
